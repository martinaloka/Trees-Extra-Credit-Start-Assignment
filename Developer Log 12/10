Task: Implemented tree.h fully.
What I worked on: Wrote templated Tree and Node implementation that:

Dynamically allocates nodes

Supports multiple parents & children

Implements createRoot, addNode, findNode, printAll, playGame, destructor
Bugs/Issues: Considered node duplication and double-free; solved by central nodesMap to own nodes.
How I resolved: Use unordered_map<string, Node<T>*> to store and iterate to delete nodes once.
Files modified: tree.h
Commit message: "Implement templated Tree/Node with full methods and memory management."
